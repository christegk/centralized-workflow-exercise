# Pasta boscaiola recipe


## Ingredients

- 3 cups vegetable broth

- 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms

- 6 ounces pancetta (or thick-cut bacon), finely diced

- 8 ounces baby bella mushrooms, quartered

- 3 shallots, finely chopped

- 5 cloves garlic, minced

- 2 tablespoons finely-chopped fresh rosemary

- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves

- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

- fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper

- 1 cup dry white wine

- 1 (15-ounce) can fire-roasted crushed tomatoes

- 3 tablespoons tomato paste

- 1 pound uncooked pasta (I used mezzi rigatoni)

- 3/4 cup heavy cream

- freshly-grated Parmesan, for topping


## Instructions

- Soften the mushrooms. 

- In a medium saucepan, stir together the broth and dried porcini.

- Bring the stock to a simmer over high heat. 

- Then reduce to low, cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until the mushrooms are tender.

- Heat the pasta water. 

- Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously-salted water to a boil for the pasta. 

- Fry the pancetta. 

- Meanwhile, cook the pancetta in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for about 3-5 minutes or until the fat has rendered.

- Use a slotted spoon to transfer the pancetta to a clean plate and set aside. Leave about 1.5 tablespoons of the pancetta grease in the pan and discard the rest. (Or if there’s not enough grease, add a bit of olive oil at any point while sautéing the veggies.)

- Sauté the veggies.

- Add the quartered baby bella mushrooms to the pan and sauté in the pancetta grease, stirring occasionally, until browned.

- Add the shallots, garlic, rosemary, thyme, crushed red pepper flakes, and a few twists of black pepper and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring frequently.

- Continue the sauce.

- Gradually pour in the white wine and use a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. 

- Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, cooked pancetta and stir to combine.

- Chop the mushrooms. 

- Meanwhile, transfer the cooked porcini mushrooms to a cutting board and roughly-chop them into bite-sized pieces. 

- Transfer chopped mushrooms to the tomato sauce, along with 1 ½ cups of the porcini broth. (Be sure to filter the broth through a fine-mesh strainer to avoid any silt that may have gathered in the bottom of the pan.)

- Simmer. 

- Reduce heat to medium-low. Continue to simmer the sauce for about 15 minutes, or however long it takes the pasta to cook.

- Cook the pasta. 

- Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until 1 minute shy of al dente. 

- Reserve 1 cup of the starchy pasta water, then drain the pasta.

- Finish the pasta. 

- Stir the cream into the tomato sauce. 

- Then combine the tomato sauce and cooked pasta in the large stockpot and gently toss for 1-2 minutes until the pasta reaches al dente, adding in a few spoonfuls of the starchy pasta water at a time if needed to thin the sauce.

- Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.

- Serve immediately with a generous sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.

## Enjoy!
