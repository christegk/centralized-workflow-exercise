# Falafel recipe

## Ingredients

- Uncooked dry chickpeas

- Shallot and garlic 

- Lemon zest

- Cumin, coriander, and cayenne

- Baking powder 

- Cilantro and parsley

- Salt

- Extra-virgin olive oil 



## Instructions

- The first step to this method for how to make falafel is soaking the chickpeas. The chickpeas need to soak for 24 hours, or at least overnight, before you form the balls. Drain and rinse them before proceeding with the recipe.

- Once the chickpeas soak, pulse them together with the other ingredients. Add the chickpeas to the food processor with the shallot, garlic, herbs, spices, lemon zest, baking powder, olive oil, and salt.

- Process until the ingredients are finely ground, but not pureed.

- Next, form the falafel balls. Scoop up the chickpea and herb mixture with a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, then use your hands to form it into balls or patties. If they’re not holding together, give the mixture a few more pulses in the food processor.

- Finally, bake! Arrange the patties on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and drizzle them generously with olive oil. Seriously, don’t hold back on the oil here! We’re not frying, remember, so a good drizzle of oil is essential for helping the balls bake up nice and crisp.
